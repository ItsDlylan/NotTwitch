# Stream Capstone

Customization Update to the current Proof of Concept build out.

This APP will allows users to stream content from their own PC
the app OBS to send video feed to my server and host it on the website for other users to watch/interact with.

This is going to test my skills with Deployment/Using a NonSQL database.

This app will bring people together without having to utilize common apps like [Twitch.tv] where they have to pick a topic and only use the topics that are approved by Twitch, allowing for user freedom to a certain degree.
